Theory - We think our library is spending a lot of time cycle checking because we were calling it too many times.
Rationale - 88% of the cumulative time is checking cycles as it took up 14 out of 16 seconds.
Outcome - After we made changes, our percentage decreased to 59% of the cumulative time of method as it only took up 
3.55 out of 6 seconds. We were right!
